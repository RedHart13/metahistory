toc-blurb: World War One is not as looked at as its later counterpart, World War Two, but it’s been subject to discussion as the War is considered to be a flash point of the change in the way the world perceives its history after and how countries perceive themselves.

### INTRODUCTION
The historiography of the World Wars is as vast as the lands and oceans that were fought on. The tales of World Wars, particularly those of World War I, have always been the subject of story. It’s many differing events and battles have changed the courses of history for many a ‘country. Many peoples and persons have been writing in the texts in time in both the famous and infamous intervals. These texts today are a window in a time since passed and aren’t always linear in their delivery of this story as there are many factors that have shape the perspectives of those who were involved.

Now, because there so many different views over so many different battles over so many years, the wars are subject to a world of scrutiny (both positive and negative). Historians have had to go back and pick though the times due to many theories of the wars, like what caused the start of WWI and WWII, who caused the wars, or were certain events necessary? During the era, the mind-set of the planet flew through the spectrum going for extreme patriotism to the want of isolationism.
# National Perspectives
The nations that participated have each their own views on the conflicts. Even the start of the wars differs of these borders. For the United Kingdom, WWI started in 1914 and WWII started in 1939. However, for the United States, WWI stated in 1917 and WWII started in 1941. In the case of World War I, the blame is one of the biggest gambles.
### Germany
Germany was ultimately the biggest loser in the Great War as she was summarily given the most blame for the destruction. Now, there is a general divide between this topic as the allied powers, after the treaty, felt rather content with the outcome. Germany on the other hand was summarily driven to what was essentially collapse as there was plenty of anger from quite a few of the Allies’ European parties, particularly the French. Despite many attempts by U.S. president, Woodrow Wilson, to try and revitalize the German state with the rest of the continent in an effort to stabilize, the rest were to have none of it as to them, it was more about the reparations.

“More generally, the whole spirit of the Versailles settlement was to treat Germany as a moral inferior…” and going so far as to imply that “she was supposed to turn over her ‘war criminals’ for trial, reimburse the victors for the material devastation that had resulted from her ‘aggression’, and – most crucial of all – accept limits on her military power unmatched by anything her former enemies agreed to.” (Trachtenberg, 491)

However, the Treaty put the sentiment in a more unbiased form.

_“The Allied and Associated Governments affirm and Germany accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nations have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies”_ (Article 321).

The way that the treaty personifies the Germen state as the main nations is rather confusing as the country was actually playing the secondary role as the Austria-Hungarians were the ones that initiated the war. Even today, the very notion is being tested as questionable because of evidence disputing it. _“…A generation of revisionists challenged and denied Germany’s sole responsibility for what they recognized as a catastrophe, but contributed it to causes more complex than the behavior of a single country and it government”_ (Showalter, 713-714).

There is also the act of want from nations as well. It is no secret that during the rise of the Third Reich in WWII, Germany was gunning for its infamous _“lebensraum”_ or _“Living Space”_, but during the great war it would and inappropriate statement to say that the waring nations didn’t have ulterior motive rather than just to protect their sovereignty as well as their allies, i.e. for some that means territory. __This motive is, at this point in history, a given, but it can be pointed out that the central powers weren’t the only ones advocating for this.__
# Political & Social Perspectives
Today, the actions described in the World War I are sometimes up in the air when it comes to their rationality as they can vary from the actions of the soldiers to the actions of the people and politicians on the home front. Not to mention the measures to which each party involved were trying to grasp. Were certain measures reached, were they missed and overshot, or were they not reached. _“Numerous investigators, and whole nations, have come to think of the dispute in terms of the validity of the Treaty of Versailles, the value of the League of Nations or the truth of socialism”_ (Cochran, 1928, 76). Of course, the climate at the time differs for the present, but during the war each of the nations/peoples had vast agendas as were as outlooks and that bleeds in the history writer of their respective populations, likely delimiting their views to a causing them to try find a narrative suit themselves rather than at least trying to seem a bit more open in their paradigms.

> “Now, as then, the national, racial, and institutional prejudices of historical writers distort their judgement, the very plenitude of evidence furnishing the material required to ‘prove’ any point of view correct” (Cochran, 77)

There was absolutely prejudice amongst the people, especially back in war times as there were many posters and pamphlets made to arouse the citizens to rise in support of the war effort and against their adversarial armies. The narratives had to be in the favor of the countries in order to gain support of the public.

# Outcomes
World War I came with many different outcomes that effected each country as they varied from great prosperity to what was basically outright collapse. Due to this, the general opinion of success is greatly overplayed. The United States and some of her allies saw post-war riches and such and Germany and her allies saw otherwise.
### Revolution
Though it occurred during the latter part of the war, the Russian Revolution greatly affected the outlook of the conflict, at least, in the eyes of Russia. “The overthrow of the monarchy in 1917 significantly influenced the perception of the war. The Bolsheviks and other left-wing socialists condemned the ‘imperialist’ goals of all the large warring countries” (Kolonitskii, 225). The Russian people’s deep distaste towards the war paired with the other political and economic unrest that plagues the nation (i.e. distrust of the Tsar and the crumbling economy due to the war), perception is skew negatively.

Now, as the story goes, Russia became the Soviet Union and control of the historical narrative and the paradigm changed to favor the U.S.S.R. “This is explained by the growing repression of the former officers who had served in the Red Army and the consolidation of Soviet control over historical science.” (Kolonitskii, 227)
# Conclusion
The Great War was one of the bloodiest conflicts of the 20th century and will, unfortunately, play the role as one of the catalysts for another war to overshadow it. Stories and writings and accounts given during and after telling the many webbed branches that all together describe one of the wars to end all wars. The historiography of the event will always be checkered as time passes and it can be gambled that it will continue to evolve.
